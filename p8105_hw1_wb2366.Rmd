```{r library}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem1
- Create a data frame comprised of:
  - a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 10
  - a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r data frame}
example_df = tibble(
  vec_df = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_df > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("mid", "low", "high", "mid", "low", "mid", "low", "high", "high", "low"))
)
```
